\subsection{Repository Initialization and Commits}
At first I got into the github website opened my account and went into the repositories menu and created a new repository named finale-assignment-repo with having a readme file inside it.
\subsection{GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}
I searched about linking up latex and git hub with github actions I made a few tags to check if its working properly.\\
for this linking i made a file with .github/workflows and copied the file was made in the class repository and pasted it on my file.\\
I've encountered many challenges and i got tired so much\\
any tag i made was checking on website and turning out to have an error in file.\\
i changed my files many times i changed names and paths to the files after some time i finally made it OK.\\
then i started writing the tex file in vscode and pushing it in the git.
